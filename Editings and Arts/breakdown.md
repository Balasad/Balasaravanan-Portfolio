# Project: Earth Healing — Short Animation

## Concept
A short cinematic journey showing the Earth transitioning from healthy → warming → damaged → healing. Designed to be visually educational and suitable for a school audience.

## Tools
- Blender (modeling, animation, cycles/EEVEE)
- After Effects (color grading, compositing)
- Audacity (sound design)

## Process
### Modeling
- Low-poly globe base with layered textures for land/water.

### Texturing & Shading
- Custom shaders for glow / heat effects.

### Lighting & Rendering
- Rim lighting for cinematic highlights; denoising on final frames.

### Compositing
- Color grading and subtle grain for filmic look.

## Files
- `render.mp4` — final render (place here)
- `behind-the-scenes/` — blend files, keyframe screenshots, material screenshots

## Notes
- Include frame rates, render settings, and approximate render time per frame.
