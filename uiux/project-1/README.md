# Project: Creative App Redesign

## Overview
**Project type:** Mobile & Web UI redesign  
**Role:** UX / UI Designer (Research, Wireframes, Visual Design, Prototyping)  
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Tools:** Figma, FigJam, Principle

## Problem
Users were overwhelmed by a cluttered homepage and poor navigation, causing low retention and task completion rates.

## Goal
Design a cleaner, accessible, and conversion-focused experience that improves onboarding completion by simplifying flows and clarifying CTAs.

## Process
### Research
- Conducted 5 user interviews and usability testing on the existing flow.
- Collected analytics to identify drop-off screens.

### Ideation & Wireframes
- Low-fidelity sketches → mid-fidelity wireframes (mobile-first).
- Created key user flows for onboarding and product discovery.

### Visual Design
- Built a pastel-themed design system: colors, typography, spacing, and components.
- Designed responsive layouts for mobile and desktop.

### Prototype & Testing
- Interactive prototype (Figma) tested with 6 participants.
- Iterated based on feedback; reduced steps in onboarding.
